      "Introducing the SBT Beam Load Cell, designed for the challenges of on-board vehicle weighing applications. Constructed from rugged alloy steel and sealed with robust potting, it's primed for heavy-duty vehicle environments. Mounting it under vehicles and trailers is straightforward.",
      "The SBT handles substantial loads beyond its capacity, and the SBT-B variant offers equivalent Unified mounting holes along with an alternate cable. Both versions cater to a range of on-board vehicle weighing scenarios, from tipper trucks to agricultural trailers.",
      "Both the SBT and SBT-B feature robust tool steel construction, IP68 sealing, and an electroless nickel-plated finish. With a 10,000kg capacity, they deliver accurate on-board vehicle weighing."
